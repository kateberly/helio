1) Create a cmd-line-type input that emulates ELQM (That takes in parameters and also miscellanious info)
    1a) (Preferably, set up a pandas dataframe for future data input)
    1b) Save as a pkl file
    1c) Save misc. info as a second dataframe for ease of use
2) Create a cmd-line-type input that emulates AQM (that interprets the above ELQM and generates a questionnaire)
    2a) eventually figure out a nice format to import into g-forms
    2b) alternatively just figure out the API and import into gforms
        2bi) goodluck
3) Create a thingy that does SPED but better (that automatically interpets a .csv file imported from g-forms)
    3a) seperate out the misc. questions from the parameter questions
