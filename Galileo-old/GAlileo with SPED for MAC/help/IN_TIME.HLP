     Rotation of spaces is extremely important in making meaningful comparisons
     between data sets.  Rotation tends to reduce spurious differences between
     data sets.

     V57 offers two comparison types.  The first is a
     time-series comparison.  A time-series comparison will rotate each space
     to the space before it.  This type of rotation will more accurately
     account for changes in the relationships among concepts over time.
