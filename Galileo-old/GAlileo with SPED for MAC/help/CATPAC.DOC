I will cluster words (or any other symbols,
for that matter) based on their frequency
of coocurrence in a window which moves
across any arbitrary ASCII text.  You may
set the size of the window (7 is a good
starting default) and the size of the slide
(1 is recommended).  You might change these
parameters depending on the particular
nature of your problem or because the
number of words you need to analyze exceeds
the capacity of the program at this setting.
I can also cluster words on a case by case
basis.  To do this separate each case with
a -1 on a separate line between each case.

My more useful analysis allows me analyze
the text with a neural network algorithm.
This analysis will yield a more 'human'
result as I look for recurrent patterns
much in the same way the human brain does.
There are a number of settings you can
control.  Run the program and press F3 for
help on any parameter to familiarize
yourself with what each does.

My most simple analysis allows me to give
you a simple frequency count of all the
words in your data set.  This is useful
for developing additional analysis
strategies.

I can also psychoanalyze your data.  Well
I can at least locate all self-reference
words or pre-determined id's.  This allows
you to locate the 'cloud' of self-points or
id-points of any given data set.  PLOT will
locate these points as a cloud of pixels in
the display.  Knowing where the respondents
are relative to the rest of the concepts in
your data set can be very useful.

I can  automatically exclude from
consideration any arbitrary list of words.
A default list is included in the file
EXCLUDE.DAT.  You can add or delete words
by using any ASCII text editor. You may
also develop any number of your own exclude
files for different runs and I suggest
that you do.

I will also include any words you may wish
to use.  Since I cannot look at all the
words in your data set, you have tell me
the number of unique words you would like
to analyze.  After I have ignored all words
below that number, I can add back any words
you specifically want to look at.
Typically these words might be product
names or specific attributes.

I expect to see myself and all my support
files in directories created for you when
you installed me.  This directory  is
called \GALILEO\RUNNER.  Do not alter the
location of any installed files or
programs, or they may not work properly.
