             I  make metric coordinates for generalized
        input data. I will read either a square matrix of
        dissimilarities, similarities, covariances, correlations,
        connections among neurons or other user supplied input, and
        project the concepts or variables corresponding to the rows
        of that matrix onto coordinates which retain the metric of
        the input matrix.

        Alternately, you may input a rectangular objects by
        attributes matrix in which each row represents some object
        and each column represents some attribute. Cell entries
        represent the numerical value of the attribute for the
        corresponding object.

        In this second case, the labels file must contain the names
        of the endpoints of the attributes following the names of the
        objects scaled. Only the positive endpoint label should be used.
        In the following example, several people and a
        cat are rated according to their height, weight and age:

 SALLY
 BOB
 JOE
 ROSS
 GEORGE
 RALPH
 FELIX
 ROXANNE
 TALL
 HEAVY
 YOUNG

      The data matrix for this example is as follows:

 (8f10.0)
 64.        112.      26.
 68.        148.      44.
 55.        90.       12.
 65.        135.      18.
 67.        120.      17.
 65.        110.      17.
 21.         12.       2.
 66.        145.      23.

      Each of the people (and the cat) are rated according to their
      height in inches, their weight in pounds, and their age in years.

      These labels can be found in \galileo\data\us.lbl and the data
      can be found in \galileo\data\us.dat.
