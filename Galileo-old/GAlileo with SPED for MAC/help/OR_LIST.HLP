     When you tell me a concept (or concepts), I am reminded of those
     other concepts that are related to it (or them).  You can list more
     than one concept, but please list them one at a time.  When you've
     finished, enter [CTRL Z].  If I'm not familiar with the concept you've
     named, or if you've misspelled it, I'll tell you about it.
