When I read the text, I take note of words that
seem to occur together. If you ask me to cycle
once, I only consider the co-ocurrences that take
place in the text.  If you ask me to cycle 2 or
more times, I let each word remind me of
whatever other words I already have learned to
associate with the words I read, and associate
those with the ones I've just read.
