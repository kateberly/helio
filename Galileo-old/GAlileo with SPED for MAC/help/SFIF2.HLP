      I need to know the exact path to the file on which you've stored
      my instructions. This file should have an input phrase on one line,
      followed by the response I'm supposed to make to this input phrase
      on the next line. These two lines make up an "input fact" and an
      "output fact"; you can make as many pairs of input and output facts
      as you like, but, if the list is long, I may take a while to learn
      it. (After all, I'm nowhere near as bright as a mosquito!)
