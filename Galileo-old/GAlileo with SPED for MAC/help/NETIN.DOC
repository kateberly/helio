      Perhaps the most important mathematical form in all multivariate
      analysis is the square matrix. I'm a simple utility that allows
      you to enter any arbitrary square matrix and normalize it in one
      or more useful ways.

      I'm called NETIN because the most general theoretical form that
      is used to describe such matrices is network. Each row or column
      of the network is called a node, and the cell entries represent
      the relationships (or connections or weights) among the nodes.

      I was created originally to deal with switching data, such as
      brand loyalty and the like. There are two kinds of switching data:
      loyalty and source of sales. Loyalty data tells the percentage of
      users of brand x that switch to brands y, z, and so forth. Source
      of sales data tells the percentage of those who switch to brand x
      that come from brands y, z and so on. I can make either type for
      you, but it's up to you to know which kind you want.
