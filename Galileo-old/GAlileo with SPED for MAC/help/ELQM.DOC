      I'm ELQM (Electronic Questionnaire Maker), and I'm the heart of the
      Galileo CATS system. I'll ask you a series of questions, and then
      build a filing system, write an electronic questionnaire, and coor-
      dinate the other programs in the CATS system.

      I need only know the name of a directory on which you want the
      study to reside. If you are going to have several different versions
      of a questionnaire, then a separate directory will be required for
      each questionnaire. (You might find it useful in such cases to create
      a master directory for the study as a whole, with a subdirectory for
      each questionnaire version.)

      I can make four kinds of question (which is all there are, I think.)
      First, I can make a complete Galileo(tm) type magnitude estimation
      paired comparisons instrument. I can also make magnitude estimation
      scales, category scales (like male=0, female=1) and Likert-type scales,
      and open-ended or in-depth questions.

      Once I've made your electronic questionnaire, you or your agents
      run SPED (the Simplified Process for Entering Data), and SPED
      will prompt you with the questions. When you (or your respondent)
      answers, the answers will be directed automatically to the correct
      files.

      I always create * files on the study directory: study.dat, study.lbl,
      and galileo.dat. Study.dat is the master control file, and contains
      all the information about the study, including the exact wording of
      every question and the file handling information. Study.lbl contains
      a list of the concept labels for the Galileo questionnaire, which are
      needed for subsequent processes. Galileo.dat contains all numerical
      data, including the paired-comparison responses and responses to all
      quantitative and categorical questions. The Galileo paired comparison
      data and the other questions are interspersed in this file in an
      obvious way; the exact format of these files is stored in study.dat.

      Study.dat is read by a program called Read. Just run Read and name
      the study directory; Read will write out the information there,
      including all relevant formats.

      In addition to these files, I will create a file for each open-ended
      or qualitative question, named after the ordinal position of the
      question. If the third question were, for example,

      3.) Discuss your summer vacation. Be brief.

      I would create a file called quest03.dat, and I would tell SPED
      to append all responses to that question to quest03.dat.
