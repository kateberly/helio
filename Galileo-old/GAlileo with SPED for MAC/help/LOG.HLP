      Unbounded scales often have long, straggly tails with inconvenient
      statistical properties. Fortunately, their logarithms are usually
      very well behaved, and the natural log transform is one of the most
      common in physical science and engineering. If you are troubled by
      outliers, try the log.  Experiment!
