      When I think, I take note of words that seem to occur together.
      Those are the words I just displayed for you.  If you ask me to think it
      over, I let each word I've already thought of remind me of whatever
      other words I have already associated and displayed.  I can do this up
      to ten times.  If you let me think too much,  I usually conclude that
      everything is related.  Thinking over once or twice is often sufficient,
      but this is a new field; experiment!
