      Each of my neurons tends to lose a proportion of its activation level
      on each cycle, otherwise everything I see would constantly be on my
      mind.  My default forgetting rate is .9.  Lowering this number makes
      me remember longer.  If I remember too long, I'll tend to see everything
      to be related to everything else.

      Now you need to enter a number between 0 and 1 which will serve as
      my new decay rate.
