     I can either use a network already developed by me or one of my relatives
     (such as Microgal, CATPAC, Kit, Netin, etc.) or I can learn from
     scratch. If you want me to start from scratch and learn a new problem,
     say 'yes'. If you want me to use a network (usually a .win file or a
     .scp file) made by another program or by myself earlier, say 'no'.
