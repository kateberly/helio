      I'm trained to help you evaluate potential strategies. You
      provide me with a goal (that is, the position you want to
      take in the market place, or where you want to go). You also
      tell me what concept (product, candidate, etc.) you want to
      move to that position.

      Then you can suggest various combinations of other concepts,
      attributes, and the like, that you think might form an effective
      strategy for moving the desired concept to the desired position.
      I will tell you how far are from that position at the start,
      how close this strategy is capable of bringing you, and what
      percentage of the original distance this would be. (Zero, of
      course, would be a perfect strategy which could take you exactly
      to the position you wish to occupy.)

      While the typical procedure is to move one concept to the
      position of another single concept (e.g., to move a product
      to the point where most people in the market can be found, or
      to another ideal point),  I am able to evaluate strategies of
      any degree of complexity. You may try to move one concept to
      the middle of any number of others; or you may try to move
      several concepts toward one other, or several concepts to the
      center of several others.

      As with any other simulator, my accuracy depends on the tested
      strategy being fully implemented, and on the fact that outside
      forces such as competitor's strategies don't change the situation
      beyond my existing knowledge. No strategy can ever be perfectly
      implemented, and outside circumstances never stand still. A wise
      analyst will always assume each strategy will be somewhat less
      effective than its simulation. But it is appropriate to compare
      strategies to each other.
