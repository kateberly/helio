                        Galileo*PLOT

      I read coordinates made by Microgal, V55, or Galnet and plot
      them graphically on the screen. Only the first three dimensions
      are plotted. The first dimension is the horizontal axis, the second
      dimension is the vertical axis, and depth is the third dimension.

      Each concept is represented as a sphere whose size is a function of
      the uncertainty of measure. The radii of the spheres representing
      the concepts is one standard error. (Measurement of the uncertainty
      of location of the concepts depends on a complete measurement of all
      pairwise distances among the concepts.)

      All Galileo programs, including CATPAC, KIT, ORESEME,
      MICROGAL and V55  provide complete pair comparison measures.
      GALNET can also do so, but allows producing ordinary perceptual
      maps from object-attribute data.  So far, only Microgal and V55
      are able to calculate the actual errors.

      When standard errors cannot be calculated, radii are defaulted to a
      convenient number which allows easy visualization, but far
      underestimates the actual error of measure. (I'll warn you when
      the errors are missing and I have to use the default radii.)

      I correct for parallel perspective according to distance from the
      eyepoint, as does the human eye. This means that objects close to
      the viewer will appear much larger than those far from the viewer.

      I allow a limited ability to interact with the plot. You can rotate
      the space up, down, left and right any arbitrary number of degrees.
      This is not as easy as it sounds, and rookies frequently become
      hopelessly lost after a few rotations. If this happens to you, just
      leave the program and start again; no harm can be done by
      experimenting.

      I currently don't support printing, but WordPerfect users can
      capture the PLOT image using the GRAB utility, and insert it into
      WordPerfect documents in the standard way.
