      If this is a real centroid scalar products matrix made by MICROGAL,
      V55, CATPAC, or ORESEME, it already has very desireable statistical
      properties. If it's some other square matrix of numbers, I'll have
      to normalize it. If you don't know, try it both ways and see which
      way works best!
