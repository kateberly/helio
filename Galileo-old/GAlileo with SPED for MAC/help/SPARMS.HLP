      How well I think and respond depends on certain parameters. Joe and
      Bill ( my programmers ) have supplied some default parameters that
      work ok in most cases; after you've become familiar with how I work,
      you might like to experiment by changing them. To accept my default
      parameters, say "no." If you want to try some changes, say yes. (You
      can't really hurt me, so by all means experiment!)
