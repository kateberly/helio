From the synaptic connections in the neural network computed by 
Catpac, I'm able to generate distances among concepts and array
them in space. Space, along with time, is fundamental to science
and engineering, since all the variables in science are derived
from distance and time. Once I construct the spatial manifold, 
Strategy can use it to calculate the projected effects of every
possible combination of messaging strategies.
