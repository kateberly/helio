     Enter the missing value for this question.  Usually a missing value is
     a number that would not normally show up as a response.  If the question
     was "What is your sex, 1=male   2=Female?"  a good missing value would
     be 9.  Make sure your missing value takes up as many columns as the
     upper bound of your question.  For example, if the range of response
     for a question is 0 to 100, enter 999 as the missing value.
