     Enter the number of data sets you would like to analyze.  I can analyze
     one data set separately.  If you specify more than one data set, I'll
     rotate them to a mainspace or to the previous space as in a time series.

     If you specify more than one data set, I will only be able to produce
     rotated coordinates.  You'll have to run each data set separately for
     messages.
