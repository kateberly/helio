                              Galileo*ELQM



      I'm ELQM (Electronic Questionnaire Maker), and I'm the heart of the
      Galileo CATS system. I'll ask you a series of questions, and then
      build a filing system, write an electronic questionnaire, and coor-
      dinate the other programs in the CATS system.

      I need only know the name of a directory on which you want the
      study to reside. If you are going to have several different versions
      of a questionnaire, then a separate directory will be required for
      each questionnaire. (You might find it useful in such cases to create
      a master directory for the study as a whole, with a subdirectory for
      each questionnaire version.)

      I can make four kinds of question (which is all there are, I think.)
      First, I can make a complete Galileo(tm) type magnitude estimation
      paired comparisons instrument. I can also make magnitude estimation
      scales, category scales (like male=0, female=1) and Likert-type scales,
      and open-ended or in-depth questions.

      Once I've made your electronic questionnaire, you or your agents
      run SPED (the Simplified Process for Entering Data), and SPED
      will prompt you with the questions. When you (or your respondent)
      answers, the answers will be directed automatically to the correct
      files.

      I always create * files on the study directory: study.dat, study.lbl,
      and galileo.dat. Study.dat is the master control file, and contains
      all the information about the study, including the exact wording of
      every question and the file handling information. Study.lbl contains
      a list of the concept labels for the Galileo questionnaire, which are
      needed for subsequent processes. Galileo.dat contains all numerical
      data, including the paired-comparison responses and responses to all
      quantitative and categorical questions. The Galileo paired comparison
      data and the other questions are interspersed in this file in an
      obvious way; the exact format of these files is stored in study.dat.

      Study.dat is read by a program called Read. Just run Read and name
      the study directory; Read will write out the information there,
      including all relevant formats.

      In addition to these files, I will create a file for each open-ended
      or qualitative question, named after the ordinal position of the
      question. If the third question were, for example,

      3.) Discuss your summer vacation. Be brief.

      I would create a file called quest03.dat, and I would tell SPED
      to append all responses to that question to quest03.dat.

                          Galileo*AQM


      ELQM (the Electronic Questionnaire Maker) makes an electronic
      questionnaire that can be administered online or by phone through
      a skilled interviewer who enters data live onto the computer using
      SPED (The Simplified Process for Entering Data). But every now and
      then, as in mailed questionnaires, mall intercepts and the like,
      there comes the need for that primitive technology, the paper and
      pencil questionnaire. I make these.

      (Actually, I only make the Galileo paired comparison parts of it,
      along with a few standard questions scientists at The Galileo
      Company always use.) That's because paired comparison questionnaires
      are very difficult to make using a word processor. The rest of the
      questionnaire is easier to make using a word processor like
      Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, so I don't do that.

      I'll write out the Galileo questionnaire on a file you choose. You
      can edit it as you like and print the questionnaires then.



                              Galileo*READ


      ELQM (the Electronic Questionnaire Maker) sets up the Galileo
      CATS system, makes the files, and automatically controls access
      to data. If you need to review a particular study after you've
      set it up with ELQM, you need me. Just tell me the name of the
      directory on which the study resides and I'll find the relevant
      information and write it out on the screen for you.




                                Galileo*SPED



      I'm the chief data entry program in Galileo*CATS.  All I need to know
      from you is the name of the directory on which the study resides (the
      "study directory"). After that, I'll prompt you for all the questions
      and automatially post the responses to the correct files.





                              Galileo*ALLSPLIT



      I'm a general purpose splitting utility. You can just tell me what
      columns you want to split on, and where you want the split files,
      and I'll do it. I can split on values or ranges.

      I can read the study.dat file made by ELQM, and so I know where your
      variables are and can help you during the split run. I can write
      out a list of the variables, and I can split by variable name as
      well as by column. I can write out all of a case or any subset of
      it; you tell me what you want written out. (Some Galileo processors
      don't want to see anything but paired comparison data in their
      files; you can get rid of all the other data using this option.)

      It may take a while to master me, but it's well worth it. I'm
      very versatile.





                            Galileo*TABLES

      I make tables out of pair comparison data. Most brand managers
      (and most social scientists, for that matter) follow Aristotle
      in dividing up their experience into objects and attributes.In
      this model, objects are defined by describing their attributes,
      so that a ball might be round, yellow and soft, or a car might
      be economical, reliable and stylish.

      In more advanced models, objects may have differential amounts
      of each attribute (every quality exists in some quantity). In
      paired comparison dissimilarities data typical of Galileo data,
      objects are arrayed at various distances from various attributes,
      so that an economical car can be close to the attribute "econom-
      ical", but a more economical car can be even closer, and so forth.

      I'll ask you for Galileo data in standard format, and I'll ask
      you to tell me which of your concepts are objects and which are
      attributes. Then I'll make tables which give the mean distances
      between each object and each attribute. I'll also make tables of
      Z for each pair of objects, which shows how they differ in their
      scores on each attribute. The difference is given in standard
      units (z-scores), and a mark ('S') is made if the differences are
      significant at the 80% level.


                               BALLOT



              I am a variation of TABLES. Iim particularly
        useful when the topic you are studying involves discrete
        choices. Elections are examples of discrete choices,
        since voters may either vote for a candidate or not.
        Expensive products such as automobiles usually may be
        considered discrete choices as well, but inexpensive
        products typically are not, since you can buy variable
        quantities of them.

              I make the same inquiries as TABLES: I ask how
        many concepts there are, on what file the concept names
        or labels are to be found, whether or not you want a
        logarithmic transformation of the data, what the name
        of your data segment is (this becomes the title of your
        table), where your data (in standard GALILEO raw data
        format) may be found, and on what file you'd like the
        output written.


              I also ask you to identify two "candidates" or products
        (I work only for two-candidate races at present, but
        I'm hoping to be upgraded soon) and a "self-concept", which
        represents a self-point or ideal point.

              I then divide up the cases into four piles: the
        first pile contains those cases closer to the first
        candidate or product; the second contains those closer
        to the second candidate or product; the third contains
        those equidistant from both candidates or products
        (the "undecided"), and the fourth contains those for
        which the crucial data is missing.

        The results are displayed on the screen and written to
        the file you named in a standard ASCII format ready to
        print.





                              GALILEO*MICROGAL


        I am the PC version of the mainframe Galileo
        computer program. I expect to read raw data in standard
        Galileo paired comparison format, and calculate the coor-
        dinates of the concepts in Galileo space. These coordinates
        may be plotted to produce a graphic picture of the data, or
        they may serve as input to other Galileo programs, such as
        Strategy and Compare.

        I also calculate the standard error for each of the
        points. These standard errors can serve as an estimate of
        the uncertaintly around the location of the points. In
        graphic representations, the standard error or some multiple
        usually serves as the diameter of the circle or sphere
        which represents the concept in Galileo space. If all
        standard sampling distribution assumptions are correct
        (which, of course, they never are) there will be about a
        67% likelihood that the concept is actually located within
        plus or minus one standard error of the location given
        by its Galileo coordinates.

        I ask for the number of concepts, the maximum
        value above which it will ignore data, the location of
        the labels file (the file were the names of the concepts
        are kept), the name (and complete path) of the file
        where the data are kept. I will also ask whether a
        logarithmic transformation of the data are desired,
        and what you want to name the output file and the
        coordinates file. The output file is the place where an
        output file suitable for printing is written, and the
        coordinates file is where coordinates for plotting or
        input into other Galileo programs are stored. You
        should supply the complete path for each of these
        files, otherwise I will write them into your
        current directory.



                        Galileo*PLOT

      I read coordinates made by Microgal, V55, or Galnet and plot
      them graphically on the screen. Only the first three dimensions
      are plotted. The first dimension is the horizontal axis, the second
      dimension is the vertical axis, and depth is the third dimension.

      Each concept is represented as a sphere whose size is a function of the
      uncertainty of measure. The radii of the spheres representing the
      concepts is one standard error. (Measurement of the uncertainty of
      location of the concepts depends on a complete measurement of all
      pairwise distances among the concepts.)

      All Galileo programs, including CATPAC, KIT, ORESEME, MICROGAL and V55
      provide complete pair comparison measures. GALNET can also do so, but
      allows producing ordinary perceptual maps from object-attribute data.
      So far, only Microgal and V55 are able to calculate the actual errors.

      When standard errors cannot be calculated, radii are defaulted to a
      convenient number which allows easy visualization, but far
      underestimates the actual error of measure. (I'll warn you when
      the errors are missing and I have to use the default radii.)

      I correct for parallel perspective according to distance from the
      eyepoint, as does the human eye. This means that objects close to the
      viewer will appear much larger than those far from the viewer.

      I allow a limited ability to interact with the plot. You can rotate
      the space up, down, left and right any arbitrary number of degrees.
      This is not as easy as it sounds, and rookies frequently become
      hopelessly lost after a few rotations. If this happens to you, just
      leave the program and start again; no harm can be done by experimenting.

      I currently don't support printing, but WordPerfect users can
      capture the PLOT image using the GRAB utility, and insert it into
      WordPerfect documents in the standard way.





                            Galileo*ASG



      I'm the Automated Strategy Generator (ASG). I can read Galileo
      Coordinates made by Microgal, V55, or Galnet, and calculate the
      likely effects of every possible strategy for repositioning any
      concept in the Galileo space. In doing this, I follow the theory
      of Woelfel and Fink, The Measurement of Communication Processes:
      Galileo Theory and Method, Academic Press, New York, 1980.

      Unlike the model in V55, I provide weighted strategies; that is,
      I can tell you my best guess as to how much to emphasize each
      element of a strategy. I can even consider negative strategies
      (such as "I am not a crook") and mixed strategies, such as
      "Luxurious, but not expensive." To be candid, however, the
      practical differences between weighted strategies and unweighted
      strategies is fairly small relative to today's (1991) ability
      to measure. Improved measurement precision (sure to come) will
      make these differences crucial, however, so it's not OK to put
      the question out of mind.

      I can only make strategies if I know what your goals are, though,
      and I'll ask you a series of questions to find out what you want
      to accomplish. If you don't know what to do at any point, just
      enter a '?'.

        *** Online help is currently not available for ASG ***


                          Galileo*WHATIF


      I'm trained to help you evaluate potential strategies. You
      provide me with a goal (that is, the position you want to
      take in the market place, or where you want to go). You also
      tell me what concept (product, candidate, etc.) you want to
      move to that position.

      Then you can suggest various combinations of other concepts,
      attributes, and the like, that you think might form an effective
      strategy for moving the desired concept to the desired position.
      I will tell you how far are from that position at the start,
      how close this strategy is capable of bringing you, and what
      percentage of the original distance this would be. (Zero, of
      course, would be a perfect strategy which could take you exactly
      to the position you wish to occupy.)

      While the typical procedure is to move one concept to the
      position of another single concept (e.g., to move a product
      to the point where most people in the market can be found, or
      to another ideal point),  I am able to evaluate strategies of
      any degree of complexity. You may try to move one concept to
      the middle of any number of others; or you may try to move
      several concepts toward one other, or several concepts to the
      center of several others.

      As with any other simulator, my accuracy depends on the tested
      strategy being fully implemented, and on the fact that outside
      forces such as competitor's strategies don't change the situation
      beyond my existing knowledge. No strategy can ever be perfectly
      implemented, and outside circumstances never stand still. A wise
      analyst will always assume each strategy will be somewhat less
      effective than its simulation. But it is appropriate to compare
      strategies to each other.




                               Galileo*CATPAC



      I'm a self-organizing neural network optimized to read and understand
      text. I can read any ASCII text and determine its underlying conceptual
      structure. Technically this means that I can learn the patterns of
      association among the various words in the text, and perform a diameter
      method hierarchical cluster analysis of these relations.

      I also write out the matrix of interrelations in a file with the
      appendix .win (weight input network). This square matrix represents
      the pattern of interrelationships among the top N words in the text
      (you have to tell me what N you desire). You can input this matrix
      to other programs (such as your favorite statistics package), or to
      other neural networks, particularly ORESEME.

      Another interesting use of the .win matrix is to give it to GALNET,
      who makes it into Galileo coordinates. These can then be plotted
      by PLOT. Perceptual maps from text is a Galileo exclusive! (You not
      only saw it here first, you can't see it anywhere else!)




                             Galileo*EXCLUDE


          Whenever CATPAC  reads text, they automatically skip certain
      words that most people don't care to examine (such as a, the, if,
      because, and so on.)

      You may have some additional words in your text you'd like to ignore,
      or, you may want to remove some words from the exclude list.

      I help you add or delete words from the exclude list.





                             Galileo*GALNET



             I  make metric coordinates for generalized
        input data. I will read either a square matrix of
        dissimilarities, similarities, covariances, correlations,
        connections among neurons or other user supplied input, and
        project the concepts or variables corresponding to the rows
        of that matrix onto coordinates which retain the metric of
        the input matrix.

        Alternately, you may input a rectangular objects by
        attributes matrix in which each row represents some object
        and each column represents some attribute. Cell entries
        represent the numerical value of the attribute for the
        corresponding object.

        In this second case, the labels file must contain the names
        of the endpoints of the attributes following the names of the
        objects scaled. In the following example, several people and a
        cat are rated according to their height, weight and age:

 SALLY
 BOB
 JOE
 ROSS
 GEORGE
 RALPH
 FELIX
 LYNNE
 SHORT
 TALL
 LIGHT
 HEAVY
 YOUNG
 OLD

      The data matrix for this example is as follows:

 (8f10.0)
 64.        112.      26.
 68.        148.      44.
 55.        90.       12.
 65.        135.      18.
 67.        120.      17.
 65.        110.      17.
 21.         12.       2.
 66.        145.      23.

      Each of the people (and the cat) are rated according to their
      height in inches, their weight in pounds, and their age in years.

      These labels can be found in \galileo\data\us.lbl and the data
      can be found in \galileo\data\us.dat.


      I am also useful for taking .WIN matrices made by CATPAC or
      ORESEME and converting them into Galileo-type coordinates which
      can then be displayed using PLOT, or may serve as inputs into
      ASG or WHATIF. To use me to convert CATPAC or ORESEME outputs
      into a form that can be read by PLOT, ASG and WHATIF, simply
      run me (GALNET), and name the .WIN file made by CATPAC or
      ORESEME when I ask where your data are. When I ask if this is
      a real Galileo, say "yes", and when I ask if this is a
      CENTROID SCALAR PRODUCTS MATRIX, say 'yes.'




                               Galileo*V5.5


      I'm a PC version of the original Galileo mainframe computer
      program. I'm a general purpose program that can do a huge
      variety of things. Learning what I can do is beyond the scope
      of this manual, and I should really only be used by advanced
      analysts. A good introduction to what I can do, along with
      a manual illustrating how to get me to do a wide variety of
      things can is The Measurement of Communication Processes, by
      Joseph Woelfel and Edward L. Fink (Academic Press, NY, 1980).

      Research and Computing Company.





                               Galileo*INTERGAL



     Galileo Version 5.5 (known affectionately as V55) is the current
     version of the original mainframe Galileo program. Originally
     designed in the 1970's, V55's architecture is hopelessly antiquated,
     but, like the dinosaurs it resembles, it's still quite powerful and
     can do several things that have not yet been ported to the PC plat-
     form. For that reason, it remains alive and is still supported.

     It is, however, essentially a batch-oriented omnibus program that
     is meant to be run with bricks of hollerith cards passed through
     a dispatch window. I am a hideous kludge designed to write a run
     stream that makes V55 work. I'll ask you a series of questions,
     then write a command file that executes a V55 run.

     Crude, but effective.

     *** Online help is currently not available for Intergal ***




                            Galileo*ORESEME


            I'm a self-organizing neural network like CATPAC. (we're
      related).  I'm optimized for conversation, however.  You can type
      words to me, and I respond with the words I associate with those
      words.  What's more, I'm self-organizing, which means I can learn
      from the conversation and change the patterns of assocations by
      paying attention to our conversations.

      I can also read .win matrices made by CATPAC and KIT, so that all
      the patterns of association they learned are instantly available
      to me.  (Don't you wish you could do that with YOUR relatives?)
      This means that I can talk to you about some text CATPAC or KIT has
      read, and I'll know the things they discovered.

      You might think of me as a non-hierarchical clustering system.  I
      read the word or words you give to me, and I find out what other
      words go with them; this set of words can be thought of as a cluster
      or category.  But I don't assign each word into only one category,
      as does a hierarchical clustering scheme, and a word can belong to
      many categories for me, as for you.  (Marketers find this helpful
      when they are trying to develop a product that can exist in, and
      compete in, several segments at once.)





                             Galileo*NETIN


      Perhaps the most important mathematical form in all multivariate
      analysis is the square matrix. I'm a simple utility that allows
      you to enter any arbitrary square matrix and normalize it in one
      or more useful ways.

      I'm called NETIN because the most general theoretical form that
      is used to describe such matrices is network. Each row or column
      of the network is called a node, and the cell entries represent
      the relationships (or connections or weights) among the nodes.

      I was created originally to deal with switching data, such as
      brand loyalty and the like. There are two kinds of switching data:
      loyalty and source of sales. Loyalty data tells the percentage of
      users of brand x that switch to brands y, z, and so forth. Source
      of sales data tells the percentage of those who switch to brand x
      that come from brands y, z and so on. I can make either type for
      you, but it's up to you to know which kind you want.





                           Galileo*FORECAST



      I can project future sales and installed base from loyalty data. By
      loyalty data I mean a square products X products matrix whose entries
      give the percentage of those who use product x that switch to product
      y during the period the matrix represents.

      I also need to know the percentage of the entire installed base that
      is represented by each of the products in the matrix, the percentage
      of each of the products that is traded during the period, and the rate
      at which each product (or its users) goes out of service during the
      period. (A car which has gone to the junk yard, for example, can't be
      traded in.)

      As you go through the program, I can help you with files, formats and
      the like. Just enter '?' whenever you don't know what to do next.
      By the way, NETIN is just the ticket for making the loyalty matrix
      I need.  Tell NETIN that FORECAST sent you!
