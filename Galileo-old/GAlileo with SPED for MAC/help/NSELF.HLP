      One of your concepts must represent either the self point (the
      point at which the respondent defines him/herself) or an ideal
      point (such as "the product I would buy") or an equivalent
      concept. I'll calculate which of the products is closer to this
      point for each of the respondents in the study, and report back
      the percentages.
