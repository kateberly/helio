     You can control the concept display in two ways.  First you can
     draw concepts all at once (Quick) or one at a time (Slow).  Second
     you may wish to display only certain concepts such as those in
     a message strategy or a particular attribute or product group.
     You may toggle each concept on or off as you like.
