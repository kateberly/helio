      I will automatically make all needed output files for you, but you
      need to tell me some generic name for all files. I'll attach the
      appropriate ending (e.gt., .cat, etc.) to the files, but you should
      provide a single word that summarizes what the topic is all about.
      If you thought th study was about cars, for example, you could enter
      "cars", and I would make the appropriate output files "cars.win",
      "cars.lbl", and "cars.cat".
