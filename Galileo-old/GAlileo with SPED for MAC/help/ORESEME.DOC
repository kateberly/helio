      I'm a self-organizing neural network like CATPAC and KIT (we're
      related).  I'm optimized for conversation, however.  You can type
      words to me, and I respond with the words I associate with those
      words.  What's more, I'm self-organizing, which means I can learn
      from the conversation and change the patterns of assocations by
      paying attention to our conversations.

      I can also read .win matrices made by CATPAC and KIT, so that all
      the patterns of association they learned are instantly available
      to me.  (Don't you wish you could do that with YOUR relatives?)
      This means that I can talk to you about some text CATPAC or KIT has
      read, and I'll know the things they discovered.

      You might think of me as a non-hierarchical clustering system.  I
      read the word or words you give to me, and I find out what other
      words go with them; this set of words can be thought of as a cluster
      or category.  But I don't assign each word into only one category,
      as does a hierarchical clustering scheme, and a word can belong to
      many categories for me, as for you.  (Marketers find this helpful
      when they are trying to develop a product that can exist in, and
      compete in, several segments at once.)
