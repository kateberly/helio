      I can project future sales and installed base from loyalty data. By
      loyalty data I mean a square products X products matrix whose entries
      give the percentage of those who use product x that switch to product
      y during the period the matrix represents.

      I also need to know the percentage of the entire installed base that
      is represented by each of the products in the matrix, the percentage
      of each of the products that is traded during the period, and the rate
      at which each product (or its users) goes out of service during the
      period. (A car which has gone to the junk yard, for example, can't be
      traded in.)

      As you go through the program, I can help you with files, formats and
      the like. Just enter '?' whenever you don't know what to do next.
      By the way, NETIN is just the ticket for making the loyalty matrix
      I need.  Tell NETIN that FORECAST sent you!
