      I'm a general purpose splitting utility. You can just tell me what
      columns you want to split on, and where you want the split files,
      and I'll do it. I can split on values or ranges.

      I can read the study.dat file made by ELQM, and so I know where your
      variables are and can help you during the split run. I can write
      out a list of the variables, and I can split by variable name as
      well as by column. I can write out all of a case or any subset of
      it; you tell me what you want written out. (Some Galileo processors
      don't want to see anything but paired comparison data in their
      files; you can get rid of all the other data using this option.)

      It may take a while to master me, but it's well worth it. I'm
      very versatile.
