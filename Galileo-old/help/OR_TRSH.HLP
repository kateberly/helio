      Like a biological neuron, each of my neurons receives inputs from
      the environment and/or other active neurons.  I add these up, and,
      if they exceed a given threshhold, are activated.  Increasing my
      threshhold decreases my sensitivity; decreasing it makes me respond
      to subtler stimuli.  For the 0-1 logistic, my default threshhold is
      .5, for all others it is zero.
