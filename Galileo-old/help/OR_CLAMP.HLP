      If you clamp on the inputs, I am constantly reminded of them; they
      are constantly in my perceptual field and never go away; it's as if
      you are bombarding me with messages. If you don't clamp them, then it's
      as if I hear them only once and let my train of thought move on as it
      will. Clamping really reinforces these messages. Use your own judgment,
      but clamping is the more common choice.  Experiment!
