      Whenever CATPAC or KIT read text, they automatically skip certain
      words that most people don't care to examine (such as a, the, if,
      because, and so on.)

      You may have some additional words in your text you'd like to ignore,
      or, you may want to remove some words from the exclude list.

      I help you add or delete words from the exclude list.
