      I'm a PC version of the original Galileo mainframe computer
      program. I'm a general purpose program that can do a huge
      variety of things. Learning what I can do is beyond the scope
      of this manual, and I should really only be used by advanced
      analysts. A good introduction to what I can do, along with
      a manual illustrating how to get me to do a wide variety of
      things can is The Measurement of Communication Processes, by
      Joseph Woelfel and Edward L. Fink (Academic Press, NY, 1980).
