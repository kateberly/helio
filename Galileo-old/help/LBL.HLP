     labels (that is, the names of the concepts in the study). This might
     be the study.lbl file made by ELQM, or the words file made by CATPAC
     or ORESEME, or it might just be a file you made with a word processor
     or editor. It just consists of the labels, up to 20 characters each,
     one label per line, as

     GOOD
     EVIL
     HITLER
     ALBERT SCHWEITZER
     BUGS BUNNY
     YOURSELF
