      The way I think depends on several parameters. Some fairly good defaults
      have been provided, and you can leave them as they are and I will work
      quite well. But, if you are interested in experimenting, or if you have
      a good reason to believe a special parameter needs to be set, then say
      'yes'. Otherwise, you can leave my defaults as they are and say 'No.'
