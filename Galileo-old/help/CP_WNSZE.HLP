I work by sweeping a moving window through the
text.  You tell me how many words should be in
the window.  If you say 5, for example, I read
words 1 through 5, then words 2 through 6, then
words 3 through 7, and so on until I've read all
the words.  I base my judgments about how words
go together on the way they occur together in
windows.  

No one knows much about how wide the window
ought to be.  The denser the data, the smaller a
window you can use.  Experiment!
