      Any n points can lie in at most n-1 dimensions. Similarly, n attributes
      can define a space of at most n-1 dimensions. That doesn't mean there
      are always that many, but that there can never be more than that.
      How many there are, you will find out by this analysis.

      Please tell me the largest number of dimensions you're willing to
      look at. (Asking for more has no ill effects, but takes a little
      longer.)
