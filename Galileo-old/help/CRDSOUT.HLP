      I need the exact path to a file on which I'll write the coordinates
      produced in this run. You can use these coordinates for input to
      other Galileo programs, such as PLOT, ASG, V55 and COMPARE. I'll
      also write out the labels on this file, but it is not possible to
      compute standard errors without actual raw data files.
