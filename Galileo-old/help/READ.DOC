      ELQM (the Electronic Questionnaire Maker) sets up the Galileo
      CATS system, makes the files, and automatically controls access
      to data. If you need to review a particular study after you've
      set it up with ELQM, you need me. Just tell me the name of the
      directory on which the study resides and I'll find the relevant
      information and write it out on the screen for you.
