I will automatically make all needed output
files for you, but you need to tell me some
generic name for all files.  I'll attach the
appropriate extension (.win, .cat, etc.) to the
files, but you should provide a single word that
summarizes what the topic is all about.

If you thought the study was about cars, for
example, you could enter "cars", and I would
make the appropriate output files: "cars.win"
which consists of the network learned; 
"cars.lbl" which contains each of the words used
in the analysis; "cars.cat', which contains a
summary of your run parameters, an alphabetic
and descending frequency listing of the words in
your analysis, and a dendogram graphically
depicting the connection between the words;
finally I'll make "cars.crd" a file used by
Plot.

Make sure your descriptor is 8 characters or
less.
