     V55 will produce a coordinate file containing the coordinates for each
     data set analyzed.  Enter the name of a file you would like V55
     to write to.  You may include a path, but keep the whole name under
     40 characters.  Galileo researchers usually use a .crd extension for
     coordinate file names.  You may use any extension you like.
