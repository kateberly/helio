I can perform a network analysis, in which 
I actually work like a human brain in 
looking for recurrent patterns, or I can 
do a fairly old fashioned coocurrence 
analysis.  You'd only do the latter for 
research purposes, in my opinion.  Let me 
'think'  unless you have a good reason not 
to.   If you must cooccur, I'm your man.
