     I can toggle back and forth between a normal and a stereographic
     projection. In stereo, I project a three dimensional image out
     beyond the screen. You will need special glasses to view this image,
     with a blue right lens and a red left lens. If you can't locate
     glasses of this kind locally, you can order them from Terra.
