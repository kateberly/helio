      If you ask for spaces the questionnaire I write will be formatted
      with spaces.  If you specify tabs, the questionnaire will be
      formatted with TAB characters.  This allows you to import the
      questionnaire into a word processor and adjust the layout of the
      questionnaire by moving the tab settings.  By answering "yes", you
      ask for tabs.
