     I'll ask you the start and end of each range you wish to check.  Here
     I'm asking you for the starting value of a range.  Again, using age as an
     example, if you were splitting on two ranges 18-24 and 25-34, and you
     were entering the start of the first range, you would enter 18.  If you
     were entering the start of the second range, you would enter 25.
