                               BALLOT



              I am a variation of TABLES. Iim particularly
        useful when the topic you are studying involves discrete
        choices. Elections are examples of discrete choices,
        since voters may either vote for a candidate or not.
        Expensive products such as automobiles usually may be
        considered discrete choices as well, but inexpensive
        products typically are not, since you can buy variable
        quantities of them.

              I make the same inquiries as TABLES: I ask how
        many concepts there are, on what file the concept names
        or labels are to be found, whether or not you want a
        logarithmic transformation of the data, what the name
        of your data segment is (this becomes the title of your
        table), where your data (in standard GALILEO raw data
        format) may be found, and on what file you'd like the
        output written.


              I also ask you to identify two "candidates" or products 
        (I work only for two-candidate races at present, but
        I'm hoping to be upgraded soon) and a "self-concept", which
        represents a self-point or ideal point.

              I then divide up the cases into four piles: the
        first pile contains those cases closer to the first
        candidate or product; the second contains those closer
        to the second candidate or product; the third contains
        those equidistant from both candidates or products
        (the "undecided"), and the fourth contains those for
        which the crucial data is missing.

        The results are displayed on the screen and written to
        the file you named in a standard ASCII format ready to
        print.
