     Galileo Version 5.5 (known affectionately as V55) is the current
     version of the original mainframe Galileo program. Originally
     designed in the 1970's, V55's architecture is hopelessly antiquated,
     but, like the dinosaurs it resembles, it's still quite powerful and
     can do several things that have not yet been ported to the PC plat-
     form. For that reason, it remains alive and is still supported.

     It is, however, essentially a batch-oriented omnibus program that
     is meant to be run with bricks of hollerith cards passed through
     a dispatch window. I am a hideous kludge designed to write a run
     stream that makes V55 work. I'll ask you a series of questions,
     then write a command file that executes a V55 run.

     Crude, but effective.
