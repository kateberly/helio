      I'm the Automated Strategy Generator (ASG). I can read Galileo
      Coordinates made by Microgal, V55, or Galnet, and calculate the
      likely effects of every possible strategy for repositioning any
      concept in the Galileo space. In doing this, I follow the theory
      of Woelfel and Fink, The Measurement of Communication Processes:
      Galileo Theory and Method, Academic Press, New York, 1980.

      Unlike the model in V55, I provide weighted strategies; that is,
      I can tell you my best guess as to how much to emphasize each
      element of a strategy. I can even consider negative strategies
      (such as "I am not a crook") and mixed strategies, such as
      "Luxurious, but not expensive." To be candid, however, the
      practical differences between weighted strategies and unweighted
      strategies is fairly small relative to today's (1991) ability
      to measure. Improved measurement precision (sure to come) will
      make these differences crucial, however, so it's not OK to put
      the question out of mind.

      I can only make strategies if I know what your goals are, though,
      and I'll ask you a series of questions to find out what you want
      to accomplish. If you don't know what to do at any point, just
      enter a '?'.
