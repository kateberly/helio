      I can rotate the picture up or down, left or right, by any amount.
      You need to tell me how many degrees you want me to rotate.

      By the way, rotations in space can be confusing if you're not
      practiced, since they are not commutative, that is, the order in
      which you do them is important. Beginners often become hopelessly
      lost. In this case, the easiest way home is to start again. You can,
      however, make some very bizarre landscapes!
