      I'm a self-organizing neural network optimized to read and understand
      text. I can read any ASCII text and determine its underlying conceptual
      structure. Technically this means that I can learn the patterns of
      association among the various words in the text, and perform a diameter
      method hierarchical cluster analysis of these relations.

      I also write out the matrix of interrelations in a file with the
      appendix .win (weight input network). This square matrix represents
      the pattern of interrelationships among the top N words in the text
      (you have to tell me what N you desire). You can input this matrix
      to other programs (such as your favorite statistics package), or to
      other neural networks, particularly ORESEME.

      Another interesting use of the .win matrix is to give it to GALNET,
      who makes it into Galileo coordinates. These can then be plotted
      by PLOT. Perceptual maps from text is a Galileo exclusive! (You not
      only saw it here first, you can't see it anywhere else!)
