     If you would like all the lines for each case written out enter Y or
     yes.  If you would only like the first n lines written out say N or
     No.  For example, each case in your data set has 12 lines, 10 lines are
     galileo data or text data and the last 2 are demographic.  If you only
     want the galileo or text data written out you would enter No.  You
     would do this to make subsequent analysis easier.
