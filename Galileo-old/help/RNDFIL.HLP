      When you installed me, you were asked to name a file where I could
      always write some intermediate results. For some reason, that file
      either was not set aside or is unavailable now. If you could name
      a file where I could write some intermediate results, I'd be fine.
      (Faster files are much better; files on the RAM disk are best; on the
      hard disk still good, but on floppy disks, could slow me down a lot.
