      The most important product of this run is the set of coordinates
      of the concepts in Riemann Space. These coordinates serve as input
      to other GALILEO programs, such as PLOT, ASG, and COMPARE. They can
      also be used as input to V55. These coordinate files will contain
      the coordinates, the concept labels and the standard errors for each
      concept.

      Here I just need you to tell me the path to a file on which you
      want me to write them. If the file doesn't exist, I'll create it.
