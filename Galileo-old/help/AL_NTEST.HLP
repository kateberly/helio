     After you have decided to split on values or ranges, I'll need to know
     how many values or ranges you wish to test.  Using age as an example, if
     you wished to split for 3 specific age values: 21, 24, and 35, you would
     enter 3.  If you choose to split on ranges and wished to test two
     ranges: 18-25 and 26-35, you would enter 2.
