     I can handle three kinds of questions: Open-Ended or text based responses.
     Magnitude Estimation e.g.: paired comparison or non-catagorized ratio
     responses (age, income, etc), and multiple choice, Likert-type scales.

     Enter the number that corresponds the question type you are entering.
