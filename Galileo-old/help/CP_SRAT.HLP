I can learn faster or slower at your command. 
My default rate of learning is .005. If you
raise this rate, I learn faster, but may
oscillate.  If you lower it, I'm a surer
learner, but it takes more time. 

Now you need to enter a number greater than
zero.  No one knows the optimal rate, and
perhaps different rates are better for different
problems, which is likely.  Experiment!
