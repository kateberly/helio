I need to know the exact path to the data 
I'm going to analyze.  These data should 
be ASCII text, or my analysis may be 
unworthy.  If the data were written on 
a standard word processor like WordPerfect
or Microsoft Word, use the conversion 
utility supplied with these programs to 
convert to ASCII (or DOS) text.
