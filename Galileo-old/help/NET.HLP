      I can either perform a network analysis, in which I actually work like
      a human brain in looking for reccurrent patterns, or I can do a fairly
      old fashioned coocurrence analysis. You'd only do the latter for research
      purposes, in my opinion. Say "yes" unless you have a good reason.
